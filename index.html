<p>Hey! My name is Hunter Line and I'm a sophmore in computer science at Montana State University. I started off my first year of college with accounting, but then I switched to computer science when I realised how much I actually liked to program. Playing the trombone and playing video games are some of my more common pastimes. Ready for a cool fact? Last summer, I hiked the Bridgers and it was awsome! Thinking about it now, that wasn't really a fun fact, but more of something fun I did over the summer. </p>
